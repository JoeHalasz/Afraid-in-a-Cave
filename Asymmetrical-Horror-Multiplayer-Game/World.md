Store for Humans is outside the cave
Monsters have a place to select the type of monster they want to be 

World is made of caves

Caves are created procedurally. 
2 cave parts. 
	Walk way 
		- Area with very little loot around
		- corners and turns
		- objects/walls to break line of site,
		- elevation changes
	Loot room
		- Medium/big open areas with more loot and things that can make noise/alert the monsters of where the humans are 
		- Less line of site breaking things 
Walk ways can connect to other walk ways (maybe 3 in a row max?)
Loot rooms must be connected by walk ways, and have 2, 3 or 4 entrances / exits
