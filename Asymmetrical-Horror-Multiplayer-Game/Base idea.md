Humans buy stuff outside at the camp
Monsters have a monster type select somewhere in the cave that gets locked off once the round starts

Round starts in a cave after the buy time / once everyone readys up. 

"Loot" is things that you could get out of a cave like certain minerals, artifacts, fossils etc.. 

Players sometimes need to make noise to get loot, this should alert some enemies to their location 

Need more and more money to win a around for every win, meaning the players need to go deeper into the caves each time to get loot.

 Caves should go on forever? maybe 
 Maybe they just generate until there is "enough" loot to win
