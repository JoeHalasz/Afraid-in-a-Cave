	Slenderman
		"death sounds" something to scare the player with. Im thinking like lots of streams all smashed together into a sound. Something that sounds like the person is going crazy if they tried to describe it to a friend.  
		This enemy is made of lots of particles and doesnt actually have a body, so maybe like some kind of humming sound for when it moves. Like a deep hum/breathing sound. Possibly some sounds that sound like when slenderman gets close to you in the games
		Jump scare sounds 
		Sound for when he picks up loot
		Sprinting sound that would scare a player, possibly something with heavy footsteps

	Bat 
		Echo location sound. Something like a battleship sonar
		Woosh sound for seeing the pathway to a player.
		Large windy wings sound for when it flies
		Screech for when alerting other enemies of where the players are. This sound is going to have a long cooldown so it can be longer and more epic. Start with a really big basey hit, then slowly make a high pitched wine - scream louder. As it gets louder make its frequency change more and more, then at the end lots of reverb
